Write tests for the following, then make the tests pass:

2) A reverseString function that takes a string and returns it reversed.

3) A calculator object that contains functions for the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.

4) A caesarCipher function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character “shifted”.

5) An analyzeArray function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: average, min, max, and length.
